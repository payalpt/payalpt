## Hi, I'm Payal Patel!

## About Me 
I'm a graduate student in Artificial Intelligence with a background in Cognitive Science, focused on building end-to-end machine learning systems grounded in strong statistical reasoning. 

My work centers around:

- Production ready ML systems
- Deep learning & time-series forecasting
- MLOps pipelines & real-time inference
- Model evaluation and performance benchmarking
- Applied AI in energy systems, speech intelligence, and robotics

I'm particularly interested in predictive modeling, decision-support systems, and scalable ML workflows.
