## Hi, I'm Payal Patel!

## About Me 
I recently completed my Master of Science in Applied Artificial Intelligence at the University of San Diego, with a background in Cognitive Science. I'm interested in  building end-to-end machine learning systems grounded in strong statistical reasoning and practical evaluation.

My work centers around:

- Production ready ML systems
- Deep learning & time-series forecasting
- MLOps pipelines & real-time inference
- Model evaluation and performance benchmarking
- Applied AI in energy systems, speech intelligence, finance, and robotics

I'm particularly interested in predictive modeling, decision-support systems, and scalable ML workflows.

## 🧠 Featured Projects
### 🦠 Multi-Disease Outbreak Forecasting with Temporal Deep Learning
Built a forecasting pipeline to predict short-term infectious disease incidence across Canadian provinces using historical weekly surveillance data. 
#### Objective:
Forecast 4-8 week disease trends and compare whether deep learning approaches outperform classical statistical baselines for public health forecasting.
#### Approach: 
- Built a province-disease time series forecasting workflow using Canadian notifiable disease surveillance data
- Prepared chronological train, validation, and test splits for forecasting evaluation
- Trained ARIMA as a local statistical baseline and LSTM as a global deep learning model
- Compared model performance using RMSE and MAE across diseases and forecast horizons
- Validated aggregated outputs against PHAC reference data to assess directional consistency
#### Focus Areas:
Time-series forecasting, deep learning, public health analytics, model comparison, applied machine learning
